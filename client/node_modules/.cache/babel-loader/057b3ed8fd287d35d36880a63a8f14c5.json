This is what brought me back to school\n            for Full Stack Development. As every developer knows, not all\n            projects get completed, some are started just to learn new skills or\n            try out new tech. Here is a collection of my sandbox projects.\n          </p>\n          <button>View Sandbox</button>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <footer>\n        <div className=\"footerWrap\">\n          <h2>Contact Me</h2>\n          <a href=\"google.com\">Github</a>\n          <a href=\"google.com\">LinkedIn</a>\n          <a href=\"google.com\">Email</a>\n        </div>\n      </footer>\n    </main>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Home;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
